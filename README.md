# Exploring-Neuro-structural-Dynamics-Age-Related-Changes-and-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Patterns

This research is to study the age-related changes and learn whether there is a possible correlation between
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and brain structure using T1-weighted MRI scans from the Open Access Series
of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. The study contains a wide range of datasets that comprise numerous
elements required to determine whether or not an individual has Alzheimer's disease and also includes
young, middle-aged, and older adults, in addition to those with extremely mild to moderate Alzheimer's
disease diagnoses and non-demented counterparts. The main goal is to achieve insights about the relation
between aging, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and structural variations in the human brain.
